# MinHook Library Files

This directory should contain:
- MinHook.x86.lib (for 32-bit builds)
- MinHook.x64.lib (for 64-bit builds)

Download from: https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases

For Turtle WoW (32-bit), we need MinHook.x86.lib

## Installation Instructions

1. Download latest MinHook release
2. Extract MinHook.x86.lib to this directory
3. Extract MinHook.x64.lib to this directory (if needed for future)

The CMakeLists.txt is configured to link against these files automatically.
