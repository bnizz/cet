# Chinese English Translator OR Chat Event Trigger (CET)

A unified World of Warcraft 1.12.1 addon that provides real-time translation of chat messages using Google Translate API with bidirectional DLL communication.

# Slop alert

This slop alert entry is pretty much the only thing I've 100% written in this entire solution. This project has relied heavily on help from AI as I am not as good a developer as I would like to be.
I'm really not even sure if the stuff in this readme or the project overview is in any way accurate - it might be a lot of bluster and hallucination. Or just best intentions that never actually got implemented.

The upload was limited to what was needed to make the thing run and I also provided the dll source.
Besides adding the addon files to CET directory in your addons folder, and the CET.dll to your root WoW folder, you probably also need to update your dlls.txt file adding CET.dll, aand you might also need to tag the dll in turtle wow launcher. You also need to create a Google Translate API key in order to make translations work.

If this doesn't work for you sorry - I hope to improve it, but I usually don't have a lot of free time. Feel free to fork it and make it better. 
I added some additional AI slop which aims to help with deploying the addon and also setting up the translate API key.
These 2 sections (Google Cloud Translation API Setup & Deployment Guide) should be all you need to actually use the solution.

Onwards with the rest of the README slop.

### Communication Flow
```
WoW Chat Event → Addon Logic → UnitXP Interface → CET.dll → Google Translate API
                     ↓                                           ↓
            Display Translation ← Lua Interface ← DLL Response ← Translation Result
```

### Key Components

1. **CET.lua**: Main event handling, chat processing, and command interface
2. **CETVars.lua**: Configuration management with persistent storage
3. **CETUI.lua**: Graphical user interface for easy configuration
4. **translator_core.cpp**: Google Translate API client with caching
5. **lua_interface.cpp**: Secure bidirectional addon-DLL communication

## Performance

### Optimizations
- **Translation Caching**: 1-hour cache prevents repeated API calls
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Smart pointers and RAII patterns
- **Minimal Hook Footprint**: Uses existing UnitXP interface
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking translation requests

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~2-5MB runtime footprint
- **Network**: Only for new translations (cached results = no network)
- **CPU**: Minimal impact on game performance

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **"UnitXP not available"**
   - Solution: Install UnitXP or compatible addon framework
   
2. **"Translator not initialized"**
   - Solution: Set valid Google Translate API key with `/cet apikey`
   
3. **"DLL not connected"**
   - Solution: Ensure CET.dll is in WoW directory and loaded
   
4. **Translation failures**
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check language codes are valid

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
```
/cet debug
```

Check the log file: `CET.log` in your WoW directory.

## Development
